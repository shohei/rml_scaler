RML scaling script
==========
2014 May, Shohei Aoki

This is a script to magnify/reduce .rml dimension to arbitraty scale.

It was developed for users of Fabmodules and MDX-40A, MDX-540, iModela, and any Roland machines which don't support serial USB.

Those Roland machines can be run by CUPS driver and lpr command. Use any Unix system (OSX, Linux).

(for example, type following in your command line : $ lpr -P Roland_MDX-40A mill.rml)


# usage
$ python scale.py
